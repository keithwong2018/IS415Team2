            Singapore is facing a serious issue of ageing population, as the elderly is projected to make up almost half of the Singapore population by 2050, according to reports by United Nations. This shift in demographic is what UOB economist Francis Tan calls Singapore’s ‘time bomb’. The majority of the elderly actually wish to remain active in the workforce beyond their retirement age. In response, the Singapore government has provided various subsidies, elderly-friendly workplace policies and arrangements etc to ensure that the workplace is more inclusive. Besides that, much has been done to ensure that other essential facilities and amenities are made accessible to the elderly.Our group hopes to offer a deeper insight into the distribution of the elderly care facilities in Singapore, and how we can make elderly-essential facilities and amenities more accessible to them.
